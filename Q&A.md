### 9. **What is the .gitignore file?**
**Answer:**  
The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing. It helps in excluding temporary files, build outputs, or sensitive data.

---

### Staging and Committing

---

### 10. **What is the staging area in Git?**
**Answer:**  
The staging area is a place where files are stored before they are committed to the Git repository. You can add files to the staging area using `git add`.

---

### 11. **How do you commit changes in Git?**
**Answer:**  
Use the following command to commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

---

### 12. **How do you check the status of a repository?**
**Answer:**  
Use the command:
```bash
git status
```
This shows which files are staged, modified, or untracked.

---

### 13. **What is git diff used for?**
**Answer:**  
`git diff` shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area, or between commits.

---

### 14. **How do you view commit history?**
**Answer:**  
Use the command:
```bash
git log
```
This shows the commit history in the repository.

---

### Branching and Merging

---

### 15. **What is a branch in Git?**
**Answer:**  
A branch is a pointer to one of the commits in the repository. It allows developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main project.

---

### 16. **How do you create a new branch?**
**Answer:**  
Use the following command:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

---

### 17. **How do you switch branches?**
**Answer:**  
Use the command:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```
Alternatively, you can use:
```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```

---

### 18. **What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?**
**Answer:**  
- **git merge**: Combines the histories of two branches, preserving the commit history.
- **git rebase**: Re-applies commits on top of another branch, effectively rewriting history to make the history linear.

---

### 19. **What is a merge conflict?**
**Answer:**  
A merge conflict occurs when changes made in two different branches overlap. Git cannot automatically merge them and requires the user to manually resolve the conflict before committing.

---

### 20. **How do you delete a branch?**
**Answer:**  
- **Local**: `git branch -d <branch-name>`
- **Remote**: `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`

---

### Tags and References

---

### 21. **What is a tag in Git?**
**Answer:**  
A tag is a reference to a specific commit in the repository, often used to mark a release point (e.g., v1.0).

---

### 22. **How do you create a lightweight tag?**
**Answer:**  
Use the command:
```bash
git tag <tag-name>
```

---

### 23. **What is HEAD in Git?**
**Answer:**  
`HEAD` points to the current branch reference in the repository, usually the most recent commit.

---

### 24. **What is a detached HEAD?**
**Answer:**  
A detached HEAD occurs when Git points to a specific commit rather than a branch. This happens when checking out a commit directly instead of a branch.

---

### 25. **What is git cherry-pick?**
**Answer:**  
`git cherry-pick` applies a specific commit from one branch to another branch, without merging the entire branch.

---

### Undoing Changes

---

### 26. **How do you undo the last commit?**
**Answer:**  
- **Soft reset** (keeps changes staged): 
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
- **Hard reset** (discards changes):
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```

---

### 27. **What is git stash?**
**Answer:**  
`git stash` temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not ready for commit. You can retrieve them later using `git stash pop`.

---

### 28. **How do you revert a commit?**
**Answer:**  
Use the following command to create a new commit that undoes the changes:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

### 29. **What is git clean?**
**Answer:**  
`git clean` removes untracked files from the working directory. Use cautiously as it deletes files not tracked by Git:
```bash
git clean -f
```

---
